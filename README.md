# Credit Default
Predicting credit default using supervised machine learning (logistic regression). Features include debt segmentation, account status, hardship, disconnection, and previous delinquency to predict likelihood of debt write-off.

What is the probability (%) of a binary outcome of debt write-off (bad=1, good=0)?
The level of confidence/probability could be used to guide pricing and collection path at the point of sale or after onboarding. 
For example, divide results into deciles of 10 and depending on the business appetite for risk, profitability margin and market share, a line can be drawn to limit the acquisition of new customers.
Alternatively, other risk mitigating processes could be implemented (such as direct debit, security deposit, shortened treatment/collection cycle) at the point of sale or when a strong predictor of bad debt becomes relevant to a customer profile.
